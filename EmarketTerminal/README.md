# ACME Emarket Terminal

This is the ACME Emarket Terminal application that allows customers to proceed with the checkout and exit the supermarket at the end of their shopping.

## How to run

After you have the server running, you should know the ip address and port of the server. For example, if the server is running on localhost with port 8080, the url is http://localhost:8080.
You must then replace the variable `SERVER_URL` in the `Constants.kt` file for the correct url.

You can then run the application on an emulator or a real device.
